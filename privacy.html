  <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: June 03, 2025</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how StoryIgnite ("we", "us", or "our"), the developer of the StoryIgnite Chrome extension, collects, uses, discloses, and protects your information.

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We collect the following information to provide and improve our extension:</p>

    <li><strong>Local Storage Data:</strong> Favorite prompts saved locally on your device using Chrome's storage API. This data remains on your browser and is not accessed by us.</li>
    <li><strong>No Personal Data:</strong> We do not collect personally identifiable information (e.g., name, email, or IP address) unless you voluntarily provide it through support requests.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
  <p>We do not sell, trade, or transfer your personal information to outside parties. We may share anonymized usage data with service providers to enhance the extension, subject to strict confidentiality agreements. We may disclose information if required by law or to protect our rights.</p>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>We implement reasonable security measures, including encryption of local storage data and secure handling of support communications. However, no online transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
